# section 2 (fundamental)
git init (initialize an empty git repository)
git config -l (show author and email)
Git config user.name / git config user.email (using local author and email instead using global information)
git status (show the working tree status)
git add (add file contents to the index)
git rm (remove files from the working tree and from the index)
git restore <file_name> (restore working tree files and discard changes)
git commit (records the changes to repository)
git log (show commit logs)
Git shortlog (show commit logs and all author)

# section 3 (branch)
git branch (list all branches)
git branch <branch_name> (create branch) *recommend => git checkout -b <branch_name>
git branch --delete <branch_name> (delete branch)
git checkout <branch_name> (switch the current activate branch)
git reflog (show all history, even deleted branches) => git checkout <hash>, git checkout -b <branch_name>
git branch -m <old_name> <new_name> (rename branch)

# section 4 (branch merge)
git ls-files -s (show all files, including conflicted file from merged braches)
git merge <branch_name> (should be on master branch and choose which branch to merge, for many people to use)
git rebase <branch_name> (one-way merge, for one user)

# section 5 (git remote)
*using SSH or Token. (Not to use http!!!)

# section 6 (interaction with git remote)
git remote add <remote_name> <http>
git remote rm <remote_name> <http>
git remote show <remote_name> (connect to net and show latest status, like new branch)
git push (upload file to GitHub)
git fetch (sync local and remote status)
Git fetch --prune (sync local and remote status and prune difference)
*tips: sync remote master to local master: 1. git checkout master, 2. git merge origin/master
git pull = git fetch + git merge origin/master
Sync process: 1. git pull, 2. Git push origin master (which is based on you're sure there is no conflict. if there is any conflict, use git fetch)
git branch -vv (show remote and local branch status and their relation)
cat .git/FETCH_HEAD (show which remote branch is default for push/pull)
git push -u origin <new_branch_name> (create new branch and connect with local branch)
